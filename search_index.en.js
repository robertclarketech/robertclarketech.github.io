1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\n\nYou can find the full repository and all previous commits by clicking here.\nPreviously, we had just finished updating our project to have seperate development and production configurations. Today we're going to changing the way we create our index.html file, do some cache-busting, and look at serving static files. Let's get started.\n\nHTML Webpack Plugin\nDevelopment\nUp until now, whenever we wanted to preview our code without using the dev server, we had to use the ./dist/index.html we created way back in part one. This sucks for a couple of reasons:\n\nWe've placed it in dist, which means it isn't source controlled. Anyone new to the project cloning it will have to make their own.\nIt had a hardcoded reference to the scriptname of main.js. If this changed in the future, we'd have to remember to change this too.\nThe html we want to display may not necessarily be static; we may want to change what's displayed based on certain compile-time parameters.\nAnytime we add anything new, like extra scripts, or css, again we have to edit this file.\n\nSo, in order to get around these problems, we can use the handy html-webpack-plugin. It's worth noting, if you're using an application server such as Express, ASP.NET, Spring, or PHP to serve your front end html, then you probably won't be using this to generate your html; those servers do that for you, usually with their own templating language. In those cases, Webpack is usually a build step for creating JavaScript, which you would then embed the normal way for those servers. The use-case for generating our html in Webpack is usually for a SPA backed by a simple web server, like NGINX or Apache.\nAnyway, let's get on with it. First, let's add the plugin:\n&gt;yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin\n\nThen we'll import and call it in our dev webpack config (we'll worry about prod later):\n//...\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin()]\n});\n\nNow we're setup, delete your ./dist folder and run yarn dev. You should now see that it's created a index.html for us, that should look something like this:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Webpack App&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nAs you can see, it's automatically inserted our script into the body for us. But, if we try to open it in a browser, nothing will render! As I'm sure you'll have already noticed, our ./src/index.tsx script has a hard dependancy on an element existing with an Id of \"root\" in order to render our React application. There's a couple of ways around this.\nWe could, for instance, remove the dependency from the JavaScript, and have it create it's own element that it attaches to:\n//...\nconst reactRootElement = document.createElement(\"div\");\ndocument.body.append(reactRootElement);\nReactDOM.render(&lt;MyComponent /&gt;, reactRootElement);\n\nIf we rerun Webpack, we can see this fixes the problem. But, if we take another look at the generated HTMl there's a number of other things wrong with it. Our html tag has no lang attribute, there's no meta viewport in the head, and the title is just \"Webpack App\". Clearly we need some way to set these. Well luckily we can set a template to be used by html-webpack-plugin.\nFirst, let's make the template we want to use. Let's create ./src/index.html and populate it with want we want:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome WebApp&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nThen, back in our webpack.dev.config, let's edit our plugins so it takes our new template:\n//...\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  plugins: [\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n      template: path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.html\")\n    })\n  ]\n});\n\nIf we rerun our Webpack command, you can now see that our ./dist/index.html file is created, using the template we specified, and appending our scripts onto the body. Let's make a commit here:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added developer html-webpack-plugin\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nLet's make the same thing but for our production build.\nProduction\nSo, we'll start off much the same way as we did for Development: we need to add the template path to our ./webpack.prod.js. Instead of repeating code between the two, we'll move what we added from ./webpack.dev.js to ./webpack.common.js. Now we probably could leave it at that for production: it would still produce what we want, but if we take a look at the options available, there's some great extras we can use here, especially around minification, so let's use those (I know it claims that these should be used automatically when the mode is set to \"production\", but I found this isn't the case).\nSo let's add it to our ./webpack.prod.js:\n//...\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  plugins: [\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n      minify: {\n        collapseWhitespace: true,\n        removeComments: true,\n        removeRedundantAttributes: true,\n        removeScriptTypeAttributes: true,\n        removeStyleLinkTypeAttributes: true,\n        useShortDoctype: true\n      }\n    })\n  ]\n});\n\nAlthough we do have to define the plugin again, since we already told it the template to use in the common config, we can safely leave that out here.\nAlright, if you build for prod now, you'll be able to see\nthat we also have minified html. It might not be saving much space right now, but every byte counts!\nLet's commit this up too:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added production html-webpack-plugin\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nCache Busting\nIf you take a look at the html-webpack-options you'll notice that one of them is called \"hash\". If you turn this on and build your project, you'll notice that the reference to the script in ./dist/index.html looks something similar to this:\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"main.js?34e8366ba7b24f3fdeab\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThose letters and numbers after the \"?\" are hash of the contents of the file: if you keep rebuilding without changing any of the source files, that hash will never change. If you do make a change however, it will be a new id. So what's the point of this? Well, the browser will cache certain files so the subsequent page loads for users are shorter. This is great for users, but not so great when we have changes we want to be pushed down. By adding a unique identifier that changes, the browser will always download the newest file.\nNow, we could do this by using this option in html-webpack-plugin, however Webpack exposes this functionality directly to us. We can modify our output property in ./webpack.common.js to use these hashes:\n//...\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  output: {\n    filename: \"[id].[hash].js\",\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  }\n  //...\n};\n\nIf you build now, you'll see that the ./dist/main.js filename itself has changed to a hash (and if you forgot to turn off hashing on html-webpack-plugin, you'll see the hash in the ./dist/index.html twice!). I personally prefer this approach, since it means we could switch to a different html plugin, or even switch to an application server, and still retain this functionality. Less coupling is always good!\nIt was only a small change, but let's do another commit here:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"changed output to id and hash\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nClean Webpack Plugin\nOne thing you might have noticed, is that when we changed the output name of our bundle, the old bundle still remained! Webpack does not clean out our distribution folder before adding new files to it. This is potentially helpful as it allows you to place static files in there that don't need building. However, without maintenence it also means that stale assets could build up. What if we just placed the entire distribution folder on our web server? At best this would just make deploy times longer, at worst it could be a security risk!\nAgain, there are a number of ways to manage this, for example, you could change the npm script in our ./package.json to remove the directory before running Webpack. We're going to use a Webpack plugin, however, for the extra flexibility it provides, and the fact it helps keep all of our configuration in one place.\nWe're going to be using clean-webpack-plugin (documentation). This one couldn't be simpler. First, let's install:\n&gt;yarn add --dev clean-webpack-plugin\n\nAnd edit our ./webpack.common.js:\n//...\nconst { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require(\"clean-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  plugins: [\n    //...\n    new CleanWebpackPlugin()\n  ]\n};\n\nAnd we're done! Run a new build and ensure the old ./dist/main.js file is removed (if you've already removed it, just create any new file and watch it get removed). As always, there are a bunch of options you can set but we don't need to set any of them for our use-case.\nAgain, it may not feel like we've done much, but let's do a new commit here:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added clean-webpack-plugin\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nStatic Files\nSo, if we are deleting the contents of our distribution folder every time we deploy, just how do we handle static files? First of all, let's mock out what we want to achieve.\nSay for instance, we want to add an image to show in ./src/myComponent.tsx:\n//...\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component&lt;{}, IMyComponentState&gt; {\n  //...\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        ...\n        &lt;img src=\"my_image.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n//...\n\nFor demonstration purposes, we're going to be using a free image taken from Pexels (although I did make it smaller for size reasons).\n\n  \n  Free image from Pexels\n\nTo begin with, we're going to place this image into a new folder in the root of our project, which we'll call static. Now we need to make Webpack aware of the files within this folder, so it can know to move them into the ./dist folder. The way Webpack knows about most files is that it starts from our entrypoint and looks at it's imports, and then looks at the imports of those imports, etc, etc. However, that also mean that Webpack will try to read and process them, and we just want them moving into dist as-is, so how do we achieve that? Well, like with our ./src/index.html, it's with a plugin.\nWe're going to be using copy-webpack-plugin (documentation) to move everything within our ./static folder to the ./dist folder.\nSo as always, let's install it:\n&gt;yarn add --dev copy-webpack-plugin\n\nAnd let's configure it:\n//...\nconst CopyWebpackPlugin = require(\"copy-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  plugins: [\n    //...\n    new CopyWebpackPlugin([\n      {\n        from: path.join(__dirname, \"static\")\n      }\n    ])\n  ]\n};\n\nIf we do a build now, you should see the file getting copied across, and after opening our ./dist/index.html, you should be able to see the image! Hurray! It even works out of the box with our dev server too!\nIt's also at this point that I realised that the content-base option in our devServer wasn't needed, whoops. Sorry about that everyone. You can remove that now, and your ./webpack.dev.js should look like this:\nconst merge = require(\"webpack-merge\");\nconst common = require(\"./webpack.common.js\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \"development\",\n  devtool: \"eval-source-map\",\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true\n  }\n});\n\nAlright, let's commit this one up too:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added static files and copy-webpack-plugin\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nThat's all for today, folks. Next time we'll cover SASS compilation, as well as file compression!\nClick here for Part 6!\n","id":"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-five/","title":"React And Webpack Tutorial - Part 5"},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-four/":{"body":"Previous\n\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\n\nYou can find the full repository and all previous commits by clicking here.\nLast time we had finished making ourselves a swanky development setup, with a live refreshing server, source maps, and even hot reloading. We're now ready to do some actual developing! But wait, we're still writing in plain old JavaScript. Sure, it might have some fancy new ES2015+ features, but it's still untyped! That just won't do, so today we're going to work on adding TypeScript support to our project.\n\nTypeScript support\nUpdating Files\nSo like everything else, adding TypeScript support is going to involve installing the compiler, a loader for Webpack, and hooking it all up. For starters however, let's just convert our existing code to TypeScript.\nFirst, let's change our file types. ./src/index.jsx will become ./src/index.tsx, and ./src/myComponent.jsx will become ./src/myComponent.tsx.\nNext, let's download the types packages for React so TypeScript knows exactly what types the packages export and so we can get proper IDE support:\n&gt;yarn add --dev @types/react @types/react-dom\n\nNow we need to fix up the files. index.tsx will need some small modifications to the imports:\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport * as ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport MyComponent from \"./myComponent\";\n\nReactDOM.render(&lt;MyComponent /&gt;, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n\nas will myComponent.tsx, along with an extra interface:\nimport * as React from \"react\";\nimport { hot } from \"react-hot-loader\";\n\ninterface IMyComponentState {\n  name: string;\n}\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component&lt;{}, IMyComponentState&gt; {\n  constructor(props: {}) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: \"\"\n    };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;label&gt;\n            Name:\n            &lt;input\n              onChange={event =&gt; this.setState({ name: event.target.value })}\n            &gt;&lt;/input&gt;\n          &lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Hello {this.state.name}!&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default hot(module)(MyComponent);\n\nI won't go into detail about what's happening here, TypeScript and React is a tutorial for a different day, but simply put, we now need an interface to describe our component state, and the way we import certains libs is different.\nWebpack Setup\nNow we're done making our files TypeScript compatible, let's actually get Webpack ready to compile them. We're going to use the awesome-typescript-loader, along with TypeScript itself:\n&gt;yarn add --dev typescript awesome-typescript-loader\n\nNote that there is a ts-loader, which kind of works, however awesome-ts-loader seems to work much better with Babel and react-hot-loader, so we're going with that.\nAnd let's create a tsconfig.json in our root repository. The example here I'm giving is just my config file, there are many options here you can tweak to your liking.\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"es2015\", \"es2016\"],\n    \"target\": \"es2016\",\n    \"module\": \"es2015\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\n    \"removeComments\": false,\n    \"preserveConstEnums\": true,\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true\n  }\n}\n\nWhat's really important here is that \"jsx\" is set to \"preserve\"; this means typescript won't change our code, and will instead let babel do that stage of the compilation for us. You might ask why we're using babel if we don't have to? Why not let TypeScript do all that work for us? Afterall, adding another compilation step is only going to make our build times longer. Well, unfortunately for us, react-hot-loader requires that code goes through babel first, so unfortunately we're stuck with this for now. If you don't find hot reloading to be a deal breaker for you, you could remove babel from the project, and tweak your tsconfig.json accordingly.\nAnyway, let's hook this all up into webpack. We're going to add a new object to rules describing .tsx, as well as update our entrypoint name:\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    entry: [\n      \"react-hot-loader/patch\",\n      path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.tsx\")\n    ],\n    //...\n    rules: [\n      //...\n      {\n        test: /\\.ts(x?)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"awesome-typescript-loader\",\n            options: {\n              useBabel: true,\n              babelCore: \"@babel/core\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n\nWhat we're telling Webpack to do here, which hopefully you can understand by now, is that for all files with a .ts(x) extension, run it through our awesome-typescript-loader (which will automatically pick up our tsconfig.json), and we've also the setup our loader to use babel (the babelCore: \"@babel/core\" is required for Babel7), which as explained earlier is required for react-hot-loader. Again, you can see the full options you can give to awesome-typescript-loader at it's relevant documentation page\nAlright, let's give it a whirl:\nyarn serve\n\nAnd... you'll probably see this error in your console:\nERROR in ./src/index.tsx\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve './myComponent' in '&lt;folder&gt;\\src'\n @ ./src/index.tsx 7:0-40 8:36-47\n @ multi react-hot-loader/patch ./src/index.tsx\n\nSo you'll notice way back when we changed the imports to ./src/index.tsx, we changed the way we import our component: import MyComponent from \"./myComponent\";. This unfortunately has confused Webpack a little bit, since by default the the only extensions it looks for are .js files, if you don't provide one in the import. So, in order to tell Webpack what files it should be looking for, we'll add another property to our resolve property:\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"react-dom\": \"@hot-loader/react-dom\"\n    },\n    extensions: [\".tsx\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".js\"]\n  }\n  //...\n};\n\nThis tells Webpack \"Hey, if you see an import without an extension, look for these filetypes\". Note that if there are multiple files with the same name, Webpack will resolve the one with the extension listed first in the array and skip the rest. See the relevant documentation here.\nFor reference, here is our full webpack config after adding TypeScript support:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: \"development\",\n  entry: [\n    \"react-hot-loader/patch\",\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.tsx\")\n  ],\n  devtool: \"eval-source-map\",\n  output: {\n    filename: \"main.js\",\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"react-dom\": \"@hot-loader/react-dom\"\n    },\n    extensions: [\".tsx\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".js\"]\n  },\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true,\n    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.js(x?)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"babel-loader\",\n            options: {\n              cacheDirectory: true\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.ts(x?)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"babel-loader\",\n            options: {\n              cacheDirectory: true\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            loader: \"ts-loader\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n\nAlright, let's try again.\n&gt;yarn serve\n\nAnd if all went well, we should now have working TypeScript support! Try changing the IMyComponentState properties or accessing a property that doesn't exist to test it out.\nLet's make a commit:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added typescript support\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nBuilding For Production\nSo you might remember, way back when in part 1 that when we first built our project using Webpack, it defaulted to 'production' mode. We've made a lot of progress since then, including updating to use Webpack config files instead of typing all of our commands on the command line, so let's try and update our project so we can build in production again!\nFirst, let's make a new configuration file. This is the one we'll point Webpack to whenever we want to build for production. Put it in the root of the project and call it webpack.prod.js. Now, we could copy over the contents of our current webpack.config.json into this one, but would be a pain to manage; if we wanted to add another filetype for example, we would need to make sure we added it in both. The DRY principle suggests we should find a better way. There's probably a number of ways you could solve this problem, but we're just going to use webpack-merge (documentation). This will allow us to define multiple configurations and, well, merge them together, surprisingly enough. Let's install it:\n&gt;yarn add --dev webpack-merge\n\nNow, let's refactor our webpack.config.json into a webpack.common.json. This will hold all the properties that are reused between our development and production configurations.\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: [\n    \"react-hot-loader/patch\",\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.tsx\")\n  ],\n  output: {\n    filename: \"main.js\",\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"react-dom\": \"@hot-loader/react-dom\"\n    },\n    extensions: [\".tsx\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".js\"]\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.ts(x?)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"awesome-typescript-loader\",\n            options: {\n              useBabel: true,\n              babelCore: \"@babel/core\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n\nNow our webpack.prod.js can merge it's own configuration into common:\nconst merge = require(\"webpack-merge\");\nconst common = require(\"./webpack.common.js\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \"production\",\n  devtool: \"source-map\"\n});\n\nAll we care about at the moment is setting our mode to \"production\" for the inbuilt changes that Webpack makes, as well as changing our source mapping mode. Now we can create something similar for development, let's call it webpack.dev.js:\nconst merge = require(\"webpack-merge\");\nconst common = require(\"./webpack.common.js\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \"development\",\n  devtool: \"eval-source-map\",\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true,\n    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  }\n});\n\nObviously we've seen all this before, the only difference here is that compared to production, we only care about running the dev server in development mode, so we keep this configuration in here. Now, we need to update our package.json scripts to point Webpack at the right configurations, which we can do with the --config flag:\n{\n  //...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\",\n    \"serve\": \"webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --open\",\n    \"dev\": \"webpack --config webpack.dev.js\",\n    \"prod\": \"webpack --config webpack.prod.js\"\n  }\n  //...\n}\n\nNote that the development builds script name has changed from \"build\" to \"dev\", just to better reflect the build it's making.\nA handy tip for webpack-dev-server: keeping --open at the end means you can pass arguments down to it, even when calling it through yarn or npm. For example, doing yarn serve firefox will actually be equivalent to webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --open firefox, allowing you to change what browser you're testing in easily.\nTry all these commands now and make sure they work as you expect. Congratulations, your Webpack project is now ready to built for an actual production environment!\nLet's make a commit here:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added production webpack config\"\n\nYou can view the commit here\nThese tutorials are going to continue for a little bit, as we continue to customise our Webpack configuration with extra niceities, but hopefully by now the magic spookiness of Webpack should be gone, and you are confident in making your own personal configuration. I highly recommend looking at the plugins section of the Webpack website, finding a few that you would find useful, and trying to implement some of these yourself.\nThat's all for this time, next time we'll look at generating our index.html using Webpack, cache-busting and serving static files!\nClick here for Part 5!\n","id":"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-four/","title":"React And Webpack Tutorial - Part 4"},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-one/":{"body":"Introduction\nWhen you're first starting to learn React, many tutorials will tell you to use create-react-app. This handy tool allows you focus on learning React, without getting bogged down in Webpack or the additional JavaScript tooling and ecosystem. This is great for people to get familiar with the language and SPA concepts, but chances are at some point you'll eventually need to dip down into webpack and make changes. The aim of this tutorial is to hopefully explain React and it's relationship with Webpack from the ground up. This tutorial (hopefully) makes few assumptions about the readers previous knowledge of React, Webpack and JavaScript tooling, but assumes a baseline knowledge of general front-end development and JavaScript.\n\nTooling\n\nEnsure you have node installed.\nThe above will install npm for you, nodes package manager. However, I strongly recommend you use yarn instead. All commands in the guide will use yarn, but there are npm equivalents for them all.\n(Optional) Ensure git is installed. This isn't a prerequisite for developing, but it's good practice to always make regular commits while developing. As a bonus, you can download any given commit for a section if you get lost.\n\nSetup\nTo start with, we're going to do git init to create a repository in our directory. This should give the following output.\n&gt;git init\nInitialized empty Git repository in &lt;directory&gt;/.git/\n\nFollow with an npm init -y to start our npm project. If all went well you should see something similar to the following in your command line.\n&gt;npm init -y\nWrote to &lt;folder&gt;\\package.json:\n\n{\n  \"name\": &lt;folder&gt;,\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n}\nOur first code\nNow we're all setup, we can make our first commit.\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"Initial Commit\"\n\nThanks to git you can follow along with the tutorial as we write code in case you get lost, or just want a point of reference. For example you can see the commit where we are right now by clicking here. The full repository can be seen by clicking here\nOk, so it's time to start actually making your react project. For starters, we need a folder to place our source code. You could put this anywhere you wanted, including the root of our project, but this would be an organisational nightmare and make it a lot harder later on when we have a large amount of files. For now, we're going to place all of our source code in a folder called src.\nInside that folder we can make our first file, index.js. This file will be known as our \"entrypoint\": all code for the application will start here and flow down.\nSo, let's go to Reacts website and steal their smallest react example. Let's place this in our index.js:\nReactDOM.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n\nUnfortunately for us, this is using .jsx syntax. We'll come onto that later, but this will need compiling into raw JavaScript for the browser to parse it (Webpack will take of that for us eventually). For now we'll make a small modification so we can run it.\nReactDOM.render(\n  React.createElement(\"div\", null, \"Hello World\"),\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\nWe will also need to install react and react-dom as dependencies:\n&gt;yarn add react react-dom\n\nAnd then import them into our index.js file:\nimport React from \"react\"; //new line\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"; //new line\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  React.createElement(\"div\", null, \"Hello World\"),\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n\nNow you may be wondering how to actually execute this script we've made. Usually in front-end development, you would create a HTML file, and place any js within  tags and then simply view that in the browser. If you tried that here however, you'd likely get a Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module error. Because we're going to making use of the compilation, minification and other -ations of webpack, we just write our JavaScript, and webpack will take care of the rest (you can and we will be making HTML files later, but for now this is the simplest example). So let's move onto that.\nSetting up Webpack\nFirst of all, webpack is a npm package, so we'll add it as a dependency first. We will also need to add the CLI tool. We use --dev to signify it's a dependency only for development, and won't be needed in the final source.\n&gt;yarn add webpack webpack-cli --dev\n\nNote that we could globally install webpack, which would mean we would not longer need to install it individually for each of our projects, however installing it as a dev dependency has a couple of advantages:\n\nThe version is pinned: even if Webpack version 357 is released, our project will always resolve the version of webpack we know works, and any breaking changes won't affect us until we're ready to migrate\nAnyone can pick up the project, and with a yarn or npm i can work on it, without having to figure which external tools they do or don't have installed\n\nFor our very first example, this is all we need to do. You can simply run yarn webpack in the command line from the root of your project and watch the magic.\n&gt;yarn webpack\nyarn run v1.17.3\n$&lt;folder&gt;\\node_modules\\.bin\\webpack\nHash: 14370ea36c1d2d237762\nVersion: webpack 4.41.2\nTime: 2399ms\nBuilt at: 10/22/2019 1:44:55 PM\n  Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names\nmain.js  129 KiB       0  [emitted]  main\nEntrypoint main = main.js\n[3] ./src/index.js 174 bytes {0} [built]\n    + 7 hidden modules\n\nWARNING in configuration\nThe 'mode' option has not been set, webpack will fallback to 'production' for this value. Set 'mode' option to 'development' or 'production' to enable defaults for each environment.\nYou can also set it to 'none' to disable any default behavior. Learn more: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/\nDone in 6.10s.\n\nYou may have noticed after running webpack, a new folder has appeared called dist in the root of the project. Since we didn't specify an input or an output, webpack made a best guess that our code is in src/index.js and that it should output the compiled code to dist. Looking inside of dist you should be able to see a main.js. Again, since we didn't specify what to call it, Webpack just made a best guess.\nLooking inside of dist/main.js you should be able to see a large amount of rather ugly code. This is what we wrote, only minified to make the binary size as small as possible. It may look like there's far more code here than what was written in our index.js, but this minified code is a single bundle that contains all of our dependencies as well, which at this point is React and React-Dom. Since we didn't specify whether we wanted a production or a development build it assumed we wanted a production one and minified the contents.\nYou can play with some of the options to get a feel for how webpack works, for example, you can pass -o &lt;directory&gt; to change the output directory, or pass --mode development to see an unoptimized development build. You can see a full list of commands with yarn webpack --help. Don't feel you have know the CLI intimately however; we will soon be passing off most of these options to a webpack config file we will create in the future, and simply point webpack to that.\nSo what now? All we have is still just a .js file. Well, if we quickly create an index.html in our dist folder, and populate it like so:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"root\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"./main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nOpening dist/index.html in your browser, you should be able to see \"Hello World!\". Congratulations, you've just gotten your first React app converted by webpack into something readable by the browser!\nFinishing Up\nYou may be tempted to make your second git commit here, but hold on just a sec! Our build process at the moment outputs our distributable files into our dist folder, however if we committed now we'd also be pushing all of these up to git! Not to mention our node_modules folder, which holds every single dependency in our application. Now this isn't necessarily a problem, however for anyone cloning our repository, this potentially adds an incredibly large download for any contributers (not to mention the poor host who has to hold them all), especially when they can build the source themselves, retrieving dependencies from their own cache and get a reproducible build. So now, we're going to add a .gitignore to the root of the project and populate it with some basic defaults:\n/node_modules/**\n/dist/**\n\nAnd now we can safely commit our next set of changes.\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added index.js\"\n\nClick here to view the commmit.\nYou might think that running Webpack for every change is a pain, as is having to create and open a html file. And you'd be right! As we move on, we'll let Webpack do more and more of the heavy lifting.\nNext time we'll look into using React's templating language JSX, creating a custom Webpack config file, and tying the two together so webpack compiles the JSX into browser readable JavaScript.\nClick here for Part 2!\n","id":"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-one/","title":"React And Webpack Tutorial - Part 1"},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-six/":{"body":"Previous\n\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nPart 5\n\nYou can find the full repository and all previous commits by clicking here.\nLast time, we started creating our dist/index.html file through Webpack, looked at how to ensure users are always getting our latest changes, and how to serve static files.

So let's tackle that first.\nAlright, let's make some CSS. We'll put this in a new folder under ./src/ called css, and create a new file called reset.css. We'll just put a basic CSS reset in here for now:\nhtml {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n\n*,\n*:before,\n*:after {\n  box-sizing: inherit;\n}\n\nbody,\nh1,\nh2,\nh3,\nh4,\nh5,\nh6,\np,\nol,\nul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  font-weight: normal;\n}\n\nol,\nul {\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\nimg {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n\nAlright, now let's import this into our ./src/index.tsx so it's picked up by Webpack:\n//...\nimport \"./css/reset.css\";\n//...\n\nIf we run Webpack now, we should see that familiar message:\nERROR in ./src/css/reset.css 1:5\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (1:5)\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders\nare configured to process this file.\n\nAnd it's right! We're going to need two new loaders for css support - the aptly named css-loader (documentation) in order to actually read and parse the styles, and then the style-loader (documentation), which will take the styles and put them in &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags on the DOM.\nyarn add --dev style-loader css-loader\n\nAnd once again, let's update our ./webpack.common.js, telling it what it do when it meets a .css file:\n//...\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      //...\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\"style-loader\", \"css-loader\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  //...\n};\n\nRemember, the loaders are always resolved from right to left, so we want it to parse the css first with css-loader, and then that css will be injected into the DOM with style-loader, so this order is important!\nAlright, let's give it a whirl. If everything went right you should now notice less padding on our elements. If you want to be sure it's working, feel free to edit the CSS (and thanks to hot reloading, it's automatically applied, and we don't lose any state!)\nLet's make a commit here:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"added css support\"\n\nYou can view the commit here (there are a couple of extra changes in this commit as I was playing around with things and forgot to revert them. Don't worry about adding these in or not, they won't matter).\nExtracting CSS\nNow this is all well and good for development purposes, however if you do a dev or production build you'll see that we aren't getting any .css files out of it, just JavaScript. Well, what style-loader does is create some JavaScript that injects the style into the DOM on load. While this works for development, in production there are many benefits to having actual .css files that are referenced in the base HTML. For starters, it'll load quicker since the browser won't need to parse, execute JavaScript and modify the DOM before getting any of the styles. It also means it can be cached by the browser.\nSo, how do we get our .css out of the .js file? Well, we can use a different loader for production: mini-css-extract-plugin (documentation). As the documentation page says, it:\n\nThis plugin extracts CSS into separate files. It creates a CSS file per JS file which contains CSS. It supports On-Demand-Loading of CSS and SourceMaps.\n\nSo this allows us to extract our CSS into seperate files, let's install it:\nyarn add --dev mini-css-extract-plugin\n\nNow, we only want to do this in production builds, where it will replace style-loader. We want to keep style-loader for development builds however, since it facilitates hot module reloading. So let's quickly extract what we put in out ./webpack.common.js to our ./webpack.dev.js:\nconst merge = require(\"webpack-merge\");\nconst common = require(\"./webpack.common.js\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  mode: \"development\",\n  devtool: \"eval-source-map\",\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\"style-loader\", \"css-loader\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nAnd now we'll modify our ./webpack.prod.js to use MiniCssExtractPlugin instead:\n//...\nconst MiniCssExtractPlugin = require(\"mini-css-extract-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader\n          },\n          \"css-loader\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    //...\n    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({\n      filename: \"[name].[hash].css\",\n      chunkFilename: \"[id].[hash].css\"\n    })\n  ]\n});\n\nSo here, we give it the new loader, and also setup the plugin itself, just giving names for our output for now. The plugin must be setup for the loader to work.\nAnd if we give it a spin with a yarn prod, you should see your new .css files are generated! Even better, our HTML plugin recognises it and immediately places it in the head of our ./dist/index.html. Just magic.\nNow we're almost ready to deploy to production, but there's another small problem; our CSS isn't minimised! Well, if we check our old friend the docs once again, this is an easy problem to solve. We'll need another plugin: optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin (documentation) so let's install that:\nyarn add --dev optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin\n\nAnd update our ./webpack.prod.js again:\n//...\nconst TerserJSPlugin = require(\"terser-webpack-plugin\");\nconst OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin = require(\"optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  optimization: {\n    minimizer: [new TerserJSPlugin({}), new OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin({})]\n  }\n  //...\n});\n\nTerserJS is the default minimizer in Webpack, we just have to respecify it here if we're applying the optimization.minimizer property. And if we run yarn prod yet again, we can now see our CSS is nicely minimized! Huzzah. Unfortunately however, it seems we've lost source mapping on our .js files, and our .css file doesn't have one either. Luckily, these are easy fixes, we just need to specify the right options to the minimizer plugins. As always you can view all the options and documentation on their relevant pages (Terser, OptimizeCssAssets), but it isn't too hard to figure out what to do:\n//...\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  optimization: {\n    minimizer: [\n      new TerserJSPlugin({ sourceMap: true }),\n      new OptimizeCSSAssetsPlugin({\n        cssProcessorOptions: {\n          sourceMap: true,\n          map: {\n            inline: false,\n            annotation: true\n          }\n        }\n      })\n    ]\n  }\n  //...\n});\n\nAlright, let's run yarn prod one last time, and presto! Source maps! Let's make a commit here to commemorate:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"css now extracts and minifies in production\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nSASS\nAlright, this one should be quick; you should know the drill by now. Let's change our ./src/css folder to ./src/scss, and change our reset.css file to reset.scss, and then update our ./src/index.tsx to point at the new file:\nimport \"./scss/reset.scss\";\n\nRunning Webpack will, you guessed it, tell us we need a new loader. We're going to be using sass-loader (documentation). With sass-loader, we'll also need node-sass which will actually do the compilation from SASS to CSS.\nyarn add --dev sass-loader node-sass\n\nAnd let's configure it to run in out ./webpack.dev.js:\n//...\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.(css|s[ac]ss)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\"style-loader\", \"css-loader\", \"sass-loader\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n\nWe update the test so this matches .scss, .sass and .css files, and put sass-loader at the end. Remember, loaders go right to left! Running yarn dev here should work fine, so let's update ./webpack.prod.js:\n///...\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.(css|s[ac]ss)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader\n          },\n          \"css-loader\",\n          \"sass-loader\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  //...\n});\n\nAnd its the same thing again. Run yarn prod just to make sure everything works ok. And we're done! SASS added to project. Let's commit here:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"added sass compilation\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nCompression\nAlright, last topic: compression! Most webservers and clients these days offer compression out of the box. This cuts down on asset size (sometimes dramatically), so let's go ahead and add that to the project as a final touch. Once again, if you're using an application server, this will probably do this for you, so there's probably no need fo Webpack here, make sure to check your Web frameworks documentation.\nWe're going to be using CompressionWebpackPlugin (documentation) to compress our assets.\nyarn add --dev compression-webpack-plugin\n\nAnd since we'll only need this for production builds, let's edit ./webpack.prod.js to use it:\n//...\nconst CompressionPlugin = require(\"compression-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  plugins: [\n    //...\n    new CompressionPlugin()\n  ]\n});\n\nThat should be all we need, run yarn prod and you should see your build files, plus a copy of all of them gzipped. Creating every file and also having a gzipped copy seems a little redundant, so let's setup the plugin so it removes the original files:\n//...\nconst CompressionPlugin = require(\"compression-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  plugins: [\n    //...\n    new CompressionPlugin({\n      deleteOriginalAssets: true\n    })\n  ]\n});\n\nBy default it uses zlib to gzip the files, however if your webserver and clients support it, and you're running Node &gt;= 11.7.0, you can use Brotli which offers superior compression quality.\n//...\nconst CompressionPlugin = require(\"compression-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = merge(common, {\n  //...\n  plugins: [\n    //...\n    new CompressionPlugin({\n      deleteOriginalAssets: true,\n      algorithm: \"brotliCompress\"\n    })\n  ]\n});\n\nAlright, we're just about done here, let's commit for a final time here:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"added compression to production builds\"\n\nYou can view the commit here.\nAlright, we're in a pretty good spot now. We've got a project with TypeScript, React and SASS compilation that minifies, produces source maps and compresses itself. If you came all this way, well done! You should be a master at using Webpack by now. There's still plenty to cover though, such as creating JavaScript Workers and PWA's, and even creating your own Loaders and Plugins. Until next time!\n","id":"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-six/","title":"React And Webpack Tutorial - Part 6"},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-three/":{"body":"Previous\n\nPart 1\nPart 2\n\nYou can find the full repository and all previous commits by clicking here.\nAlright, last time we had a working Webpack config and a single JSX file. Today we're going to work on making ourselves a dev environment, with an auto-reloading dev server.\n\nSetting up a Development Webpack Config\nFirst off, I'm basically going to be covering the very helpful development guide over at Webpack website. At this point, you should understand the ecosystem well enough to be able to follow this yourself. You can skip ahead to hot reloading if you prefer to follow that one instead, but we're going to forge ahead here anyway.\nAs an aside, you may notice at this point that we're going to spending most of our time setting up Webpack loaders and addons, and you'd be right. Once you're initially set up, that's all Webpack is - chaining together existing toolchains (such as typescript, sass and babel compilation, minification, and compression) into one pipeline.\nMode\nSo first of all, since we're building for development, we're going to tell Webpack that that is our aim; add mode: 'development' to our webpack config:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: \"development\"\n  //...\n};\n\nEssentially, this line is an alias for a number of Webpack optimizations, as well as letting any plugins we're using know what environment we're in so they can react accordingly as well. You can see the full list of changes that setting the mode changes at Webpack's documentation page.\nSource Maps\nSince we're compiling our code from ES2015+ syntax, when we view it when developing, it's going to be hard for anyone (including ourselves!) to understand and debug it. That's where source maps come in. Source maps \"map\" the code to what was originally written, and the browser will automatically show you the original code. To enable this, we'll add another option in our Webpack config devtool: \"eval-source-map\"\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  devtool: \"eval-source-map\"\n};\n\nThere are a number of different mapping schemes you can use: some are recommended for development purposes, others for production. You can see the full list and their details on the relevant Webpack configuration page. For now, eval-source-map is satisfactory for us.\nDev Server\nIf you read the above link, Webpack recommend three tools for testing development changes:\n\nwebpack's Watch Mode\nwebpack-dev-server\nwebpack-dev-middleware\n\nThe pros and cons are listed in the article, but we're just going to focus on webpack-dev-server since it's the most featureful while still being easy to setup.\nFirst, let's install it:\n&gt; yarn add --dev webpack-dev-server\n\nThen we'll edit our ./webpack.config.js to use it, telling it where it should serve our built files from:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  devServer: {\n    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  }\n};\n\nUPDATE 2019/10/28 - This line isn't actually necessary, you can leave any devServer configuration off for now\nAs always, there are a bunch of options here we aren't using, for a full reference of devServer see Webpacks documentation. And now we can run:\n&gt;yarn webpack-dev-server --open\n\nThis should cause your browser to open, and run our code. You may notice that control of the terminal is not given back either; webpack-dev-server is still running, and watching our code. Go ahead and make a simple change in our ./src/index.jsx file:\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\n//change anything in the tags here\n//                       ||\n//                       \\/\nReactDOM.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello, worlds!&lt;/h1&gt;, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n\nSave your file, and voila! You should notice your changes are picked up by the terminal, they will be rebuilt, and your browser will refresh to automatically reflect the changes.\nIt's great that we no longer have to build every time, but it's a pain to write out yarn webpack-dev-server --open every time, and more importantly, how would someone joining our project know they have to run this line? To solve this, let's make a quick script in our ./package.json file to alias this for us. Under \"scripts\", add: \"serve\": \"webpack-dev-server --open\" (note we don't need the yarn here, that's automatically inferred for us). Now we can simple call yarn serve and get the same effect. While we're here, we can also add a script for building without the dev server: \"build\": \"webpack\", and update our \"main\" to be \"index.jsx\":\n{\n  \"name\": \"react-webpack-tutorial-part-one\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.jsx\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\",\n    \"serve\": \"webpack-dev-server --open\",\n    \"build\": \"webpack\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^16.10.2\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.10.2\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@babel/core\": \"^7.6.4\",\n    \"@babel/preset-env\": \"^7.6.3\",\n    \"@babel/preset-react\": \"^7.6.3\",\n    \"babel-loader\": \"^8.0.6\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^4.41.2\",\n    \"webpack-cli\": \"^3.3.9\",\n    \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^3.9.0\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"description\": \"\"\n}\n\nThis seems like a good place for a commit, so let's do one here:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"setup development environment\"\n\nView the commit here.\nHot Reloading\nHaving the browser refresh on code change is nice enough, but doesn't it still suck to lose all your stateful data? In order to demonstrate this, let's expand our React a little bit.\nLet's create a new component called myComponent.jsx in our src folder, and we'll just create a very simple component:\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: \"\"\n    };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;label&gt;\n            Name:\n            &lt;input\n              onChange={event =&gt; this.setState({ name: event.target.value })}\n            &gt;&lt;/input&gt;\n          &lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Hello {this.state.name}!&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAnd let's add this to our index.jsx:\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport MyComponent from \"./myComponent.jsx\";\n\nReactDOM.render(&lt;MyComponent /&gt;, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n\nAnd let's start up our dev server with yarn serve. Playing with our new component, you can see that as we type, the text gets saved to Reacts state, and is then inserted to the line below as \"Hello !\". But, if we decide to change our file, for example if we change \"Name:\" to \"Names:\", lo and behold, our dev server picks up the changes, refreshes the browser, and our input is gone. Very annoying. Well, thanks to react-hot-reloader, we can avoid this!\nFirst of all, let's install the necessary dependencies:\n&gt;yarn add react-hot-loader\n&gt;yarn add --dev @hot-loader/react-dom\n\nAnd update our .babelrc file with \"plugins\": [\"react-hot-loader/babel\"]:\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"@babel/preset-env\", \"@babel/preset-react\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"react-hot-loader/babel\"]\n}\n\nNow, we need to mark our component that it should be hot reloaded. In ./src/myComponent.jsx:\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { hot } from \"react-hot-loader\";\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: \"\"\n    };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;label&gt;\n            Name:\n            &lt;input\n              onChange={event =&gt; this.setState({ name: event.target.value })}\n            &gt;&lt;/input&gt;\n          &lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Hello {this.state.name}!&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default hot(module)(MyComponent);\n\nWe import the hot method, and instead of exporting the Component directly, we export export default hot(module)(MyComponent);. Note that this is the old syntax, the new syntax should allow us to direct export without the module word like so: export default hot(MyComponent); but I couldn't get this to work Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.\nUsually, most React projects will have a single root component that controls the flow of the entire application, and just making this component hot will make your entire application hot, so you only need to do this once.\nNext we update our webpack.config.js. First update your entry array to also take 'react-hot-loader/patch' like so:\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: [\"react-hot-loader/patch\", path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.jsx\")]\n  // ...\n};\n\n(in all honestly I have no idea what this does, just that react-hot-loader requires it). Next, add a new property called \"resolve\" and alias react-dom to the one we installed earlier:\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"react-dom\": \"@hot-loader/react-dom\"\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nThis replaces the \"react-dom\" package of the same version, but with additional patches to support hot reloading.\nAnd finally, update our devServer property so it runs in hot mode:\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true,\n    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  }\n};\n\nAfter all this, your webpack.config.js should look like this:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: \"development\",\n  entry: [\n    \"react-hot-loader/patch\",\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.jsx\")\n  ],\n  devtool: \"eval-source-map\",\n  output: {\n    filename: \"main.js\",\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  },\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"react-dom\": \"@hot-loader/react-dom\"\n    }\n  },\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true,\n    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.js(x?)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"babel-loader\",\n            options: {\n              cacheDirectory: true\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n\nAlright, let's do another yarn serve and load up our app. You should now be able to type into the textbox, and despite any changes you make to the file, your state should be kept! Very cool.\nThat's all for this time, let's make a quick commit:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"added hot reloading\"\n\nView the commit here.\nNext time we'll look into getting TypeScript support for our JSX components, as well as setting up a Webpack config for our production environment.\nClick here for Part 4!\n","id":"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-three/","title":"React And Webpack Tutorial - Part 3"},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-two/":{"body":"Previous\n\nPart 1\n\nYou can find the full repository and all previous commits by clicking here.\nWelcome back. Last time, we left off with a basic Hello World React app that we had just gotten working by using Webpack to bundle it. Today we're going to convert that to a JSX file and setup a Webpack configuration file.\n\nJSX and Webpack config\nIf you remember last time, when we took Reacts basic example, it looked like this:\nReactDOM.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n\nThis is Reacts JSX templating language, which allows you to define HTML inside of your JavaScript. Let's change our current file back to this version.\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nReactDOM.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n\nAnd if we try to run yarn webpack like previously, we get an error:\n&gt;yarn webpack\nyarn run v1.17.3\n$ &lt;folder&gt;\\node_modules\\.bin\\webpack\nHash: 1862c125716c06df2a51\nVersion: webpack 4.41.2\nTime: 338ms\nBuilt at: 10/22/2019 4:27:18 PM\n 1 asset\nEntrypoint main = main.js\n[0] ./src/index.js 354 bytes {0} [built] [failed] [1 error]\n\nWARNING in configuration\nThe 'mode' option has not been set, webpack will fallback to 'production' for this value.

Learn more: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/\n\nERROR in ./src/index.js 3:16\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (3:16)\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file.

Basically, this is Webpack telling us it encountered something strange and it didn't know how to parse it. This makes sense, since although we passed it a .js file, the contents were not valid JavaScript.\nSo to start solving this problem, let's make our intentions clearer. First, let's rename our src/index.js to index.jsx. This doesn't actually fix anything, but let's anyone looking at it know it's a JSX file. If you happen to run yarn webpack again you'll now notice it gives the error Insufficient number of arguments or no entry found. and ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in &lt;folder&gt;. This is because the src/index.js file it was previously looking for is now gone, and Webpack doesn't know where our entrypoint is.\nNow, create a webpack.config.js in your folders root directory and populate it like so:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.jsx\"),\n  output: {\n    filename: \"main.js\",\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  }\n};\n\nLet's break this file down a bit now. The top line is a NodeJS import. Using Node libraries in frontend development may seem a little strange, but since Webpack is a build tool build with Node, we have access to these. We're going to be using the path library to ensure we have clean, sanitized folder paths.\nNext we have the module.exports line. All Webpack configuration files will have this line, and it is essentially an object defining our custom Webpack configuration. Everything else in this file will be a property on module.exports.\nThen we have the entry property, this defines our entrypoint, and after that we have the output, which defines where to place our Webpackified files and what to call the final bundle. Within both of these we're using the Node library path, just to make sure that whatever we pass here is appropriate for the operating system ('/' instead of '\\' for example). Together, this webpack configuration is the equivalent of doing yarn webpack ./src/index.jsx -o ./dist.\nWe can run Webpack with our newly created configuration file by doing yarn webpack. If there is any file called webpack.config.js, then Webpack will automatically pick it up, and use that for it's configuration. If your config file is called something else, you can use yarn webpack --config &lt;config_name&gt; to specify the filename.\nSo we have a Webpack configuration file, but even if we run it, we still get the same error! So what's the point? Well, now we can move onto some of the real meat of Webpack, loaders.\nLoaders and Babel\nTo quote Webpack's website\n\nOut of the box, webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON files. Loaders allow webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.\n\nBasically, loaders allow us to use filetypes other than JSON and JavaScript with our application. There are hundreds of these available on npm for whatever filetype you might want to use, or you can create your own if one doesn't already exist.\nIn order to use JSX syntax, we're going use Babel in order to compile it into JavaScript, which can then be understood by Webpack. Babel will also gives us some other fringe benefits, such as the ability to use ES2015+ syntax in browsers that don't support it.\nIn order to use Babel, we will need to download the core, the react-preset for react support, preset-env so we can use ES2015+ features, and the babel-loader so Webpack can use it.\n&gt;yarn add --dev @babel/core @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-env babel-loader\n\nAgain, these are all dev dependencies, we won't be including any of these packages in our final build.\nNow we've installed the loader, we need to tell Webpack when to use it. Update your webpack.config.js to look like the below:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: path.resolve(__dirname, \"src\", \"index.jsx\"),\n  output: {\n    filename: \"main.js\",\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.js(x?)$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"babel-loader\",\n            options: {\n              cacheDirectory: true\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n\nAs you can see, we've added a new property called module, and underneath module we've added rules. Rules are an array of objects that tell Webpack \"Hey, when you meet a file that matches these conditions, use this loader with this configuration\". As you can see here, we currently only have one object under rules. The first property this object has is test: this is a pattern to match on the filename. Here, we're telling it to match every file which ends in .js, and optionally x so it matches our .jsx file as well. This means all of our JavaScript and JSX files will be compiled by Babel, allowing us to both compile JSX and use ES2015+ syntax in any .js file in one rule.\nAfter that we have the property use, which is an array of loaders that should be used on any matched file. You can have multiple loaders for a single file, and note that they will always be called from right to left. For now however, we just have the one loader. Some loaders will also have options you can specify, for example here we are telling babel-loader to use a cache, so that we can avoid needing to run the potentially expensive Babel recompilation process on each run. You can see all the babel-loader options on it's GitHub page.\nYou might try now to run webpack again, except we'll be greeted with a new error:\nERROR in ./src/index.jsx\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js):\nSyntaxError: &lt;snip&gt; Unexpected token (3:16)\n\n  1 | import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n  2 |\n&gt; 3 | ReactDOM.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n    |                 ^\n  4 |\n\nIt's still erroring! And in the same place! Well, this is because we still haven't told Babel to use the presets we installed, and without knowing about @babel/preset-react, Babel still doesn't know how to consume our JSX file. So, in the root of your project create a file called .babelrc. Inside of here, we're simply going to specify what presets Babel should use:\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"@babel/preset-env\", \"@babel/preset-react\"]\n}\n\nNow if you looked on babel-loader's GitHub page, you might notice that we could specify the presets there under options:\n//...\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  use: {\n    loader: \"babel-loader\",\n    options: {\n      presets: [\"@babel/preset-env\"],\n      plugins: [\"@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread\"]\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nNow, again this isn't necessarily wrong, however this approach has a couple of disadvantages\n\nIf we want to change it, we have to dive into our webpack file. Later on, when we have many loaders, this could be somewhat of a pain\nIf we wanted to use babel for other filetypes, we'd have to copy it every time\nAnd most importantly, this means this information is only available to Webpack. If we wanted to change to Parcel, or use the Babel CLI for exmaple, then we'd have to pull these out regardless\n\nPutting this information in a seperate .babelrc file makes it more accessible, reusable and easier to edit.\nIt's also worth noting that while this .babelrc file works for our purposes, there's lots of configuration options you can set. For example, babel-preset-env's documentation page recommends that you specify which browsers you wish to support like so:\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\n      \"@babel/env\",\n      {\n        \"targets\": {\n          \"edge\": \"17\",\n          \"firefox\": \"60\",\n          \"chrome\": \"67\",\n          \"safari\": \"11.1\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n\nWithout this, it will just compile all ES2015+ code, which is probably a little inefficient. For now we don't care, but it's definitely worth checking all your Babel presets and plugins to make sure it's being set up right before shipping to production!\nFinishing Up\nSo, now that we're finally finished with all that, you can run yarn webpack again and... presto! We've finally managed to compile our .jsx file into something that can be understood by browsers.\nThis seems like another good point for a commit, so we'll do just that:\n&gt;git add .\n&gt;git commit -m \"Changed to use JSX, added Webpack config, and setup Babel\"\n\nYou can view this commit here.\nTune in next time where we'll set up a dev server to view changes as we make them, including hot reloading!\nClick here for Part 3!\n","id":"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-two/","title":"React And Webpack Tutorial - Part 2"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-five/":{"body":1080,"title":5},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-four/":{"body":1087,"title":5},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-one/":{"body":878,"title":5},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-six/":{"body":1035,"title":5},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-three/":{"body":943,"title":5},"https://www.robertclarke.tech/blog/react-webpack-tutorial/part-two/":{"body":960,"title":5}},"length":8}};
